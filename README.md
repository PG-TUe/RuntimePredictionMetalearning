# RuntimePredictionMetalearning

The scripts used for my course at TU/e.

Metafeature_extractor.py is the script which creates the metadata set.

Pearson calculates the pearson coefficients for the meta-features (with respect to the actual runtime).

Metalearning compares the runtime predicting of simple guessing versus machine learning.
